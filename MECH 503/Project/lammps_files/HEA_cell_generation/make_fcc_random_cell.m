%% This program generates a fcc random solid solution hea with Ne elements
% The code will generate 10 different random cells for an equiatomic HEA
% containing 4 elements. You can read these files with the script provided
% in ELASTIC folder and modify the cell generation command by read_data as
% shown below (line 26 - 34). Potential file usage is also illustrated below. 
% This code is part of a much larger project hosted in github: 
% https://github.com/Mponga/HEA_vacancy_mcml

[Pars] = input_cnn();

    % Print LAMMPS file to read with read_data command.

\section{Introduction}
This project proposes a comprehensive review of Weak Galerkin (WG) finite element 
method for the Navierâ€“Stokes equations. It aims to delve into the methodology, findings, 
and implications of applying the Weak Galerkin (WG) Finite Element Method to solve 
the Navier-Stokes equations, which are fundamental in describing fluid motion as well as in 
more advanced fields, such as Fluid Structure Interaction (FSI).

\section{Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Understand the WG Finite Element Method's development (scheme) and its application to the Navier-Stokes equations.
    \item Discuss the existence and uniqueness of the WG Finite Element Method's solution.
    \item Perform the error estimate and analysis of the WG Finite Element Method.
    \item Evaluate the method's effectiveness (convergence rate), and computational efficiency.
    
    % \item Explore potential applications in complex fluid dynamics problems.
\end{itemize}

\section{Methodology}
The project will start from reviewing relavant articles and then presenting a summary of the article's contributions. 
% a critical analysis of  its methodology (mathematical formulation, error estimates, numerical experiments), 
Moreover, a comparison with traditional finite element methods could be conducted.

\section{Expected Outcomes}
The review aims to clarify the WG Finite Element Method's contributions to computational 
fluid dynamics, discussing its strengths, limitations, and future research directions. 
It will also provide insights into the method's engineering applications, such as FSI mentioned previously.

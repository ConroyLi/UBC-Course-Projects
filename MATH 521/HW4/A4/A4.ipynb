    "### Notes \n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment is concerned with implementation and empirical convergence studies. There will be a little bit of theory but it purely formal - no proofs are required. I will not give too detailed instructions or have model codes ready to be completed. But you are of course allowed (in fact encouraged) to use as much of the codes from class as you wish. In fact the assignment requires again relatively minimal adaptation of my model codes.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may add as many solutions cells as needed to implement your numerical methods and tests. To help with Q2 I advise that you implement it in a structured way based on function calls rather than a single script, so you can then re-use those functions for the convergence study. For the study of singularities, you should be able to import and use the codes from class directly, you should not need to adapt them at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "In principle you may of course write your own code from scratch using a different (but similarly low-level) finite element package. Unless you already have experience with such a package I don't recommend this since it would be a fairly time-consuming undertaking. If you plan to do this please check with me so I can be sure the code you are using is suitable. "

\section{Main Idea}
2D, wave generator, FSI, homogenous or non-homogenous ship/boat, free surface between fluid and air, gravity



\section{Experimental and numerical study of the vertical motions
of a bulk carrier and a Ro–Ro ship in extreme waves s40722-015-0019-1}

cruise vessels encountering rogue waves, such as Grand
Voyager (February 2005) (Bertotti and Cavaleri 2008), Norwegian
Dawn (April 2005) (Didenkulova et al. 2006) and MS
Louis Majesty (March 2010) (Cavaleri et al. 2012), confirm that ships might be exposed to extreme environment conditions
during its lifetime, including encounters with abnormal
waves, whose damaging effects have already been pointed
out by Faulkner and Buckley (1997).

The wave generator is fully computer controlled
and a software is implemented which enables the generation
of transient wave packages, deterministic irregular sea
states with predefined characteristics as well as tailor-made
critical wave sequences (Clauss and Kühnlein 1996; Clauss
and Schmittner 2005). The technique has been established to
reproduce a large variety of wave sequences such as single
abnormal waves as well as groups of rogue waves embedded
in irregular sea states to investigate the response of floating
structures to an extreme, but realistic, wave environment
(Clauss et al. 2004).

I could use the model of wave in this paper to simulate the real situation.

partially submerged, vertical cylinders s40722-019-00137-8}
wave presented but finite difference ,3D, rigid vertical cylinder submerged in water

\section{Experiments and calculations of cnoidal wave loads on a flat plate
in shallow-water /s40722-014-0007-x}
vertial flat plate, more experimental

\section{Simulation of floating structure dynamics in waves by implicit
coupling of a fully non-linear potential flow model and a rigid
body motion approach s40722-014-0006-y}
2D potential flow floating

The floating idea comes here
